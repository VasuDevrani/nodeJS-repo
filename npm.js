// npm -- global command, comes with nodeTest

// local dependency - use it only for a particular project

// global dependency - use it for any project

// command - npm i <PAckageName>

// package.json - manifest file that conatains all *information* about package/project, to setup thi json file, we have three approaches
// package.json is also important as it contains the depedencies needed to run project and we can just share it merely without sharing the whole large sized modules
// manual app - create package.json and manully add all the properties
// npm init and steps
// npm init -y (automatic)

// after creating package.json all new dependencies will be added to it as soon as they are installed
// alongwith each installation, node modules are created which contains all the *files and data*
